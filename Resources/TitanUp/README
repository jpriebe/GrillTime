Each module that needs to access other modules within the libary will need a reference to the top-level
TitanUp module.  It must have a private TU member as well as a TUInit() function so that the parent library
can initialize the TU variable immediately after requiring the module.

Each application module that needs to access the library should require it thusly:

var TU = require ('TitanUp/TitanUp');
