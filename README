Grilltime Upfit

- splash screens -- all new sizes; change master size to 2000x3332

- appicon: 
  - need @3x versions

- icons:  would need @3x versions, but we'll just go ahead and use icon fonts

- latest TitanUp; remove Sizer calls

- ios8: need to call Ti.App.iOS.registerUserNotificationSettings to get
  permission from the user to send local notifications

- fixed back button text on ios

- TableView aesthetics
  - borders - look dated, especially with the rounded corners
  - separators - look crappy, especially on iOS 7+ -- indented on left only, and showing up on empty rows


**** TitanUp changes
 - TGWM
 - UI
